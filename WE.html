									<h2>Engineering Intern - Eastern Municipal Water District</h2>
									<p>During my Engineering Internship at the Eastern Municipal Water District in the summer of 2022, I collaborated closely with six professional engineers, contributing to a range of water projects encompassing Booster Stations, Pipelines, and water treatment facilities. My responsibilities involved comprehending the fundamentals of each project, reviewing and offering input on project drawings. Moreover, I played a key role in project administration by developing a database that facilitated streamlined access to project files, encompassing previous versions of project drawings and potential references.</p>
									<p>One significant project task involved creating a functional spreadsheet leveraging data from projects over the last five years. This spreadsheet enabled engineers to estimate project costs accurately. I received gratifying feedback during a recent meeting with the engineers, affirming the accuracy and utility of the tools I had developed, significantly aiding ongoing projects. Additionally, I contributed to advancing pipeline projects by conducting terrain mapping, assessing changes in elevation, and devising pathways that minimized slope alterations while reducing the quantity of piping required.</p>
									<p>In addition to these tasks, I actively participated in revising existing standards and specifications, integrating new advancements to support the future evolution of designs. Furthermore, I conducted extensive research on items beneficial to projects, obtaining approvals and successfully incorporating them into the agency's approved materials list. My contributions during the internship enabled the creation of tools streamlining the preliminary design process and enhanced ongoing projects and resources, paving the way for improved future designs. Overall, this internship experience cemented my passion for engineering by teaching me about the inner workings of one of the most important infrastructures of society.</p>
